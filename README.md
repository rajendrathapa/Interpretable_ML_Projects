Machine-learning using PiML toolbox

This is is collection of various popular machine-learning projects worked out using the PiML (Python Interpretable Machine Learning) toolbox. 
PiML is gaining siginificant interest from the data science and quantitative modeling community because of its capabilities of creating highly powerful machine-learning algorithms while still being interpretable. 
The GUI offered by the toolbox for the users is unmatched and it makes model development, diagnostics and interpratation very simple. Details about the toolbox can be found <a href="https://github.com/SelfExplainML/PiML-Toolbox" target="_blank">here</a>.
